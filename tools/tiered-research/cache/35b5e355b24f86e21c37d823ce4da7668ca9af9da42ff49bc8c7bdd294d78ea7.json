No official release date has been announced. CEO Sam Altman has stated that GPT-5 is in development but requires further advancements in safety, reliability, and capabilities before release.\n\n### Key Statements from OpenAI\n- **July 2024 (Sam Altman on X/Twitter)**: Altman confirmed GPT-5 is \"still a ways off,\" emphasizing the need for more compute and research. [Source: Sam Altman's X post](https://x.com/sama/status/1816029054538475957)\n- **September 2024 (OpenAI Blog/Events)**: OpenAI released **o1** (formerly \"Strawberry\"), a reasoning-focused model family, as a major interim step. No GPT-5 mention. [Source: OpenAI o1 Announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/)\n- **October 2024 (DevDay)**: OpenAI unveiled **o1-pro** and API expansions, but skipped GPT-5 details. Altman reiterated focus on \"next-generation\" models without specifics. [Source: OpenAI DevDay Recap](https://openai.com/index/devday-2024/)\n\n### Rumors and Speculation\n- Leaks suggest training involves massive compute (e.g., 10x GPT-4 scale), but unverified.\n- Expected features: Multimodal (text, image, video), advanced reasoning, agentic capabilities.\n- Analysts predict **late 2025** at earliest, pending regulatory hurdles.
