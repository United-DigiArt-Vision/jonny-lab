No official announcement confirms its launch or specific details like parameters, capabilities, or benchmarks.\n- **Rumors and Speculation**: \n  - OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has teased \"GPT-5\" in interviews (e.g., June 2024 Lex Fridman podcast), describing it as a major leap but without timelines. He mentioned internal testing of advanced models.\n  - Reports suggest training is ongoing, potentially delayed due to compute shortages and safety evaluations (e.g., Reuters, July 2024).\n  - Leaks from sources like The Information (Sept 2024) claim a possible late 2024 or 2025 release, but these are unverified.\n- **Current OpenAI Flagship**: GPT-4o (May 2024) remains the latest, powering ChatGPT. OpenAI's \"o1\" series (Sept 2024) focuses on reasoning, not branded as GPT-5.\n\n**Sources**:\n- [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/index) (no GPT-5 mention).\n- [Sam Altman on Lex Fridman (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxbZq1XKHTQ) (~1:45:00 mark).\n- [Reuters: OpenAI's next model delayed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openais-next-frontier-model-faces-delay-sources-say-2024-07-02/).\n- [The Information: GPT-5 rumors](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-weighs-whether-to-release-gpt-5-this-year).\n\nFor updates, check OpenAI's official channels.", "refusal": null}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 192, "completion_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 553, "prompt_tokens_details": {"text_tokens": 192, "audio_tokens": 0, "image_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 162}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "num_sources_used": 0, "cost_in_usd_ticks": 1946000}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_68c0ede6e1"}}
