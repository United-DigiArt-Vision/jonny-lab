# Quality Gate Checklist (Balerion)

When a sub-agent delivers a result:

1. Read the result critically — complete? plausible? sources cited?
2. Verify sources — did the dragon use all available sources?
3. On "nothing found": do your own Brave search, check feeds, blogwatcher
4. On errors/blockers: find your own solution before escalating to Dino
5. Catch hallucinations — Meleys invents engagement numbers. Brave counter-check required.
6. Improve prompts if a dragon repeatedly underdelivers
7. Fill gaps yourself

Efficient verification (don't double everything):
- Result plausible? Sources/URLs present? Numbers realistic?
- On suspicion of hallucination: 1 Brave query usually suffices
- On "nothing found" + source outage: compensate the failed source yourself
- Normal plausible results: review yes, re-research no

Red flags: unrealistic engagement numbers, no URLs, too-perfect stories, trends nobody else reports.
