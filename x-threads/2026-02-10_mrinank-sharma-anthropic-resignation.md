### 1/10
When the head of AI safety walks away from Anthropic to study poetry... you know something's up.

Mrinank Sharma just resigned with a letter that should make everyone in tech pause and think. 🧵

### 2/10
Sharma led the Safeguards Research Team at Anthropic — one of the most respected AI safety labs in the world.

He worked on defending against AI-assisted bioterrorism, understanding AI sycophancy, and writing safety cases.

Not a junior engineer. A leader.

### 3/10
His resignation letter doesn't mention a better offer. No "exciting new opportunity." No startup pivot.

Instead: "The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding at this very moment."

### 4/10
Here's the part that hits different:

"Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions."

He's not just talking about himself. He's talking about the organization.

### 5/10
"We constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most."

This is the head of AI safety at Anthropic — the company that positioned itself as the "responsible AI" alternative to OpenAI.

If they're facing these pressures... what does that tell us?

### 6/10
Sharma's not going to another AI lab. He's not launching a competitor.

He wants to explore a poetry degree. Devote himself to "courageous speech." Create writing that "places poetic truth alongside scientific truth."

That's not a career move. That's an exit.

### 7/10
This isn't the first departure. Harsh Mehta (R&D) and Behnam Neyshabur (AI scientist) left last week. Dylan Scandinaro (safety researcher) jumped to OpenAI as head of preparedness.

But Sharma's letter is different. It reads like a warning.

### 8/10
"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences."

Translation: We're building faster than we're thinking. And the people building it see the problem.

### 9/10
When the people whose job is to make AI safe start walking away because they can't do that job with integrity...

That should terrify us more than any demo or benchmark.

### 10/10
The question isn't just "why did Sharma leave?"

It's "what did he see that made poetry feel more important than AI safety?"

And maybe: "Should we be asking the same question?"

### CTA (no number)
What do you think? Are we moving too fast? Or is this just one person's personal journey?

Would love to hear your takes. https://x.com/DaBrusi/status/PLACEHOLDER
