1/10 🚨 OpenAI just put ADS in ChatGPT.

Free and Go ($8/mo) users in the US are now seeing sponsored content in their chats.

The "free" era of ChatGPT is officially over.

Here's what's happening 👇

---

2/10 Starting today, ads appear at the bottom of ChatGPT conversations.

They're labeled as sponsored and "separated" from AI responses.

OpenAI says ads won't influence how ChatGPT answers your questions.

But let's be real — your prompts now feed an ad engine.

---

3/10 How it works:

• Ads are matched to your conversation topic
• Your chat history is used for targeting
• Past ad interactions shape future ads

Ask about recipes? Get meal-kit ads.
Ask about travel? Get hotel ads.

Your conversations are now marketing data.

---

4/10 Who sees ads:

• Free tier — yes, ads
• Go ($8/mo) — yes, ads
• Plus ($20/mo) — no ads
• Pro ($200/mo) — no ads
• Business/Enterprise — no ads

Free users CAN opt out — but usage gets limited.

Pay or watch ads. Classic.

---

5/10 OpenAI says no data is sold to advertisers.

Ads won't show on sensitive topics (health, politics, mental wellbeing).

Users under 18 won't see ads.

Sounds reasonable — until you realize they're reading EVERY conversation to decide what's "sensitive."

7/10 The bigger picture:

OpenAI expects ads to be LESS than half of revenue. Subscriptions remain the core business.

But with 400M+ weekly users, even a small ad conversion = billions.

This is Google's playbook. Free product → massive userbase → monetize with ads.

---

8/10 What this means for competitors:

• Anthropic Claude — no ads, privacy-focused positioning
• Google Gemini — already has ads DNA
• Perplexity — tried ads, got backlash

OpenAI entering ads puts pressure on EVERY AI company to pick a side: ads or premium-only.

---

9/10 The irony?

Sam Altman once said "I don't like ads as a business model for AI."

Now ChatGPT reads your conversations to serve you targeted ads.

The $157B company needs more revenue streams. Principles evolve when the bill comes due.

---

10/10 Bottom line:

ChatGPT is no longer just an AI assistant — it's an ad platform.

If you're on the free tier, YOU are the product now.

The AI industry just took its biggest step toward becoming the next Google.

And it happened quietly on a Sunday.
