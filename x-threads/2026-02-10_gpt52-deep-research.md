1/9 🚨 BREAKING: OpenAI just upgraded Deep Research in ChatGPT to GPT-5.2.

This isn't just a model swap — it's a completely different research experience.

Rolling out now. Here's what changed and why it matters 👇

2/9 What's new in Deep Research:

• Powered by GPT-5.2 (previously used older models)
• Connect to apps directly inside ChatGPT
• Search specific sites during research
• Track real-time progress as it works
• Interrupt and redirect mid-research with follow-ups

## Tweet 3
3/9 The biggest change: Deep Research is becoming an actual research AGENT.

Before: You ask a question → wait → get a summary.

Now: You can watch it work, throw in new sources halfway through, and change direction without starting over.

That's a fundamental shift in how AI research works.

4/9 Why the timing matters:

Sam Altman hinted last week that a new model would drop between Feb 9-15. This is it.

Meanwhile:
• ChatGPT is back to 10%+ monthly growth
• Codex saw 50% growth (GPT-5.3-Codex called "insane" internally)
• OpenAI declared "code red" in Dec 2025 — now they're shipping fast

5/9 The competitive angle is wild right now.

Anthropic just committed to keeping Claude ad-free. OpenAI started testing ads in ChatGPT TODAY.

But while everyone debates ads vs. no ads — OpenAI quietly shipped the most powerful research tool available to consumers.

Features > drama.

6/9 What Deep Research with GPT-5.2 means for professionals:

• Competitive analysis → real-time, multi-source, redirectable
• Due diligence → connect to specific databases and sites
• Market research → fullscreen reports with live progress
• Academic research → interrupt with new papers mid-session

This replaces hours of manual work.

7/9 The AI research tool landscape right now:

• OpenAI Deep Research → GPT-5.2, app integration, real-time tracking
• Google Gemini → strong at multi-modal but no live research agent
• Perplexity → fast search, but no mid-research control
• Claude → great for analysis, no dedicated research mode

OpenAI just pulled ahead in this category.

## Tweet 8
8/9 What to watch:

• How fast GPT-5.2 Deep Research rolls out globally
• Whether the app integrations expand beyond ChatGPT's current connectors
• Quality difference vs. the previous Deep Research model
• How Perplexity and Google respond

The research tool war is just getting started.

9/9 Bottom line:

While the internet argues about ads in ChatGPT, OpenAI shipped a genuine product upgrade that changes how millions will do research.

GPT-5.2 Deep Research isn't just faster — it's a new category: AI research you can steer in real-time.

The best AI updates are the ones you actually use. This is one of them. 🚀
