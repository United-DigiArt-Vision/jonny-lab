1/12 🚨 Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei just sat down with @dwarkesh_sp for 2 hours.

His message: "We are near the end of the exponential."

A "country of geniuses in a data center" — in 1-3 years. Not 10. Not someday.

Here's everything he said 👇

---

2/12 Anthropic's revenue growth is insane:

• 2023: $0 → $100M
• 2024: $100M → $1B
• 2025: $1B → $9-10B
• January 2026 alone: another few BILLION added

That's 10x growth per year. And the curve isn't bending yet.

---

3/12 On coding — Dario says we're almost there:

"We have engineers at Anthropic who don't write any code."

AI coding gives ~15-20% total factor speedup today. Six months ago it was 5%. Six months from now? Way more.

End-to-end software engineering: 1-2 years.

---

4/12 The scaling hypothesis hasn't changed since 2017.

RL scaling works EXACTLY like pre-training scaling. Same log-linear curves. Not just math — across a wide variety of tasks.

"I don't think I've seen very much that is not in line with it."

---

5/12 What about on-the-job learning? Models can't build context like a human employee over months, right?

Dario's take: you might not even need it.

A million-token context window = days of human learning. And they're working on making contexts even longer. "It's an engineering problem, not a research problem."

A like or repost helps more than you think 🙏

6/12 "Diffusion is real but not cope."

AI adoption is WAY faster than any previous technology. But not instant. Enterprise procurement, legal reviews, security compliance — it all takes time.

Even Claude Code, which is dead simple to set up, takes months to roll out at a 3,000-person company.

---

7/12 Computer Use is the real bottleneck right now.

OSWorld benchmark: went from 15% → 65-70% in just over a year. When this crosses reliability thresholds, AI can do ANY digital job — video editing, browsing, form-filling, research.

That's the unlock for the "country of geniuses."

---

8/12 On China and AI geopolitics:

Dario wants chip export controls enforced. His logic: whoever holds the stronger hand when the "rules of the road" are negotiated wins.

"What will not come easily is distribution of benefits, political freedom. These are the things that are going to be hard."

---

9/12 On AI regulation:

• Tennessee tried to ban emotional AI chatbots → "That law is dumb"
• Banning ALL state regulation for 10 years with no federal plan → "Crazy"
• His approach: start with transparency, escalate when threats are proven
• Drug approval reform is needed ASAP — the pipeline will get jammed

---

10/12 The bioterrorism risk is real and growing.

"I could certainly imagine, as soon as later this year, saying: AI bioterrorism stuff is really serious. We should do something about it."

Anthropic runs bioclassifiers already. He wants this as a standard, not optional.

---

11/12 Hardest thing for future historians to grasp?

"At every moment of this exponential, the extent to which the world outside it didn't understand it."

And how fast everything was happening. Critical decisions made in 2 minutes with half a page of context.

---

12/12 The bottom line from the CEO building the models:

90% confident: "country of geniuses in a data center" within 10 years.
50/50 hunch: 1-2 years, maybe 1-3.

"I think it's crazy to say this won't happen by 2035. In some sane world, it would be outside the mainstream."

We're watching the exponential end in real time. 🚀
