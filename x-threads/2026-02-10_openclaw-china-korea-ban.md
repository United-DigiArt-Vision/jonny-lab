### 1/9 🚨
OpenClaw just made headlines in China and South Korea — and not for the reasons you'd expect.

Major Korean tech companies (Kakao, Naver, Karrot Market) have BANNED it from corporate networks. China's industry ministry issued warnings about security risks.

What's going on? 🧵

### 2/9
For context: OpenClaw is an open-source, self-hosted AI agent that launched in November 2025. Think of it as the "hands" for LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude.

While LLMs provide the brain, OpenClaw executes — browsing the web, editing files, running commands, controlling devices.

### 3/9
It uses modular "skills" (extensions hosted on ClawHub) to automate workflows, interact with services, and control systems locally. No cloud dependency. Full user control.

Sounds powerful? It is. And that's exactly why governments are paying attention.

### 4/9
South Korea's biggest tech companies have restricted or banned OpenClaw within their corporate networks:

• Kakao: "To protect information assets, use is restricted"
• Naver: Full internal ban
• Karrot Market: Blocking both use AND access

Their concern? Data leaks, system manipulation, cyberattacks.

### 5/9
China hasn't issued an outright ban — but the industry ministry identified cases of OpenClaw running with "inadequate security settings" and called for stronger safeguards:

• Rigorously review public network exposure
• Implement strong authentication & access controls

The message is clear: use with extreme caution.

### 6/9
Security firms are sounding alarms too:

• SlowMist & Koi Security: Hundreds of compromised extensions deploying infostealers (e.g., Atomic Stealer)
• Palo Alto Networks: OpenClaw has a "lethal trifecta" — access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, ability to communicate externally while retaining memory

### 7/9
Here's the paradox: the very features that make OpenClaw powerful (local execution, modular extensibility, system-level access) are what make it a security concern in corporate environments.

It's not a bug. It's a feature — and a responsibility.

### 8/9
This isn't just about OpenClaw. It's about the shift happening right now: autonomous AI agents that can ACT, not just respond.

When governments start issuing warnings, you know the technology has crossed a threshold. The question isn't IF agents will transform work — it's HOW we manage the transition.

### 9/9
The takeaway?

OpenClaw is powerful enough to scare governments. That's not a weakness — it's proof of impact.

But power demands responsibility. Open-source doesn't mean uncontrolled. Autonomy doesn't mean reckless.

The AI agent era is here. Are we ready?
