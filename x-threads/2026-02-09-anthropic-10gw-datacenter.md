🚨 BREAKING: Anthropic is building its OWN data centers

They just hired ex-Google veterans to build up to 10 GIGAWATTS of computing capacity

That's roughly $500 BILLION worth of infrastructure

Here's what's happening 👇

2/
For years, Anthropic rented compute from AWS and Google Cloud

Now they're going independent — building from the ground up

Why? Their biggest cloud providers (Amazon, Google) are also their COMPETITORS in the AI race

The numbers are insane:

• 1 GW data center = ~$50 billion to build
• Anthropic is planning up to 10 GW
• $180B committed for AI compute through 2029
• First facilities: New York + Texas ($50B FluidStack deal)

---

4/
They recruited former Google executives who built some of the world's most advanced data centers

These people know site selection, construction, power supply agreements — the hardest parts

Google operates dozens of hyperscale facilities globally. Now that expertise works for Anthropic

Why build your own?

• Optimize hardware specifically for Claude's training + inference
• Negotiate directly with chip suppliers (Nvidia, custom silicon)
• Stop paying rent to competitors
• Full control over the AI compute stack

---

6/
The biggest bottleneck: POWER

US utilities can't keep up with AI electricity demand. Wait times for new grid connections stretch YEARS

Anthropic's team must secure power equivalent to small cities — and they're competing with every other AI company for it

---

7/
Context: This comes days after Anthropic's $20B+ funding round at $350B valuation

They're also preparing for an IPO later in 2026

The money is flowing directly into compute infrastructure — the real moat in the AI race

---

8/
The AI infrastructure arms race right now:

• Meta: $60B+ on AI infra in 2025 alone
• Microsoft: massive Azure expansions
• Google: 1M TPU partnership with Anthropic
• OpenAI: Stargate project
• Now Anthropic: building their own empire

Fun timing: One day after Anthropic's Super Bowl ad mocking ad-funded AI, OpenAI started showing ads in ChatGPT

The rivalry between these two companies is getting more intense by the week

---

10/10
Anthropic is no longer just an AI research lab

They're becoming a full-stack AI infrastructure company

From cloud tenant to building a $500B computing empire — this is the biggest strategic shift in the AI race this year

The question: Can they secure enough power before everyone else?
