### Tweet 1/9 — BREAKING Hook

```
1/9 🚨 BREAKING: Anthropic's Head of AI Safety just resigned.

His warning? "The world is in peril."

Not just from AI — from a "whole series of interconnected crises unfolding."

Here's what he said (and why it matters) 👇
```

### Tweet 2/9 — Who is Mrinank Sharma?

```
2/9 Meet Mrinank Sharma:

• Head of Safeguards Research Team at Anthropic
• Led AI safety protocols for Claude
• Elite academic credentials (Oxford/Cambridge background)
• Resigned February 9, 2026 — effective immediately

He didn't leave quietly. He posted a public resignation letter on X.
```

---

### Tweet 3/9 — The Warning

```
3/9 In his resignation letter, Sharma warned:

"The world is in peril — not just from AI, but from bioweapons, global politics, and breakneck technological change."

His words: "A whole series of interconnected crises unfolding."

This isn't a tech debate. This is existential.
```

---

### Tweet 4/9 — Why He Left

```
4/9 Sharma's reason for quitting?

"I want to pursue work that aligns with my integrity."

Translation: He couldn't square his values with the direction AI development is heading.

And he's not staying in tech.

He's leaving to write POETRY. Yes, poetry.
```

---

### Tweet 5/9 — Beyond AI

```
5/9 Sharma's concerns go beyond AI:

• Bioweapons development accelerating
• Global political instability rising
• Technological disruption outpacing governance
• Interconnected crises compounding faster than solutions

His take: Technical work alone won't save us.

### Tweet 6/9 — Bigger Picture

```
6/9 This is part of a bigger trend:

AI safety researchers are leaving top labs.

• OpenAI lost multiple safety team members in 2025
• Google DeepMind saw safety talent departures
• Now Anthropic — the company FOUNDED on AI safety — loses a key leader

The pattern is clear.
```

---

### Tweet 7/9 — Why Anthropic?

```
7/9 Anthropic was supposed to be DIFFERENT:

Founded by ex-OpenAI safety-focused researchers, Anthropic positioned itself as the "responsible AI" company.

If the HEAD OF SAFEGUARDS can't align his integrity with the work...

What does that say about the industry?
```

---

### Tweet 8/9 — What to Watch

```
8/9 What to watch next:

• Will other Anthropic safety researchers follow?
• How will Anthropic respond publicly?
• Will this slow Claude development?
• Will regulators take notice?

Safety exits at this level are rare. And they matter.
```

---

### Tweet 9/9 — Fazit

```
9/9 The takeaway:

When the person building AI safety guardrails walks away saying "the world is in peril"...

That's not just a resignation. That's a signal.

AI isn't slowing down. The question is: Are we racing toward progress or toward something else? 🚀⚠️
