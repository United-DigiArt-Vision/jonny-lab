1/9 🚨 BIG TECH IS GOING ALL-IN ON AI — AND THE NUMBERS ARE INSANE

Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google are about to spend $588 BILLION on AI infrastructure in 2026.

That's 2% of the entire U.S. economy — flowing into data centers, chips, and compute power.

Here's the breakdown 🧵

2/9 💰 THE SPENDING BREAKDOWN

• Microsoft: $123B (up from $83B in 2025)
• Meta: $125B (up from $72B)
• Amazon: $155B (up from $125B)
• Alphabet/Google: $185B (up from $92B)

Total: $588 BILLION

These aren't small increases. These are DOUBLE or MORE in one year.

3/9 🏗️ WHAT ARE THEY BUILDING?

This money isn't going into salaries or marketing.

It's going into:
• Massive data centers (GW-scale power)
• Custom AI chips (TPUs, Trainium, etc.)
• GPU clusters (NVIDIA H100/H200 hoarding)
• Cooling infrastructure (liquid-cooled racks)
• Power deals (nuclear, solar, grid upgrades)

Physical infrastructure. At unprecedented scale.

4/9 📊 WHY INVESTORS ARE SPOOKED

Stock market is nervous. Big question: "Will this pay off?"

$588B is a MASSIVE bet that:
1. AI demand keeps exploding
2. Compute = competitive moat
3. Future revenue justifies today's spending

History lesson: Amazon's AWS spending freaked out investors in 2010s — then AWS became a $100B/year cash machine.

5/9 ⚔️ THE REAL WAR

This isn't about better chatbots.

It's about CONTROL.

Whoever owns the most compute wins:
• Model training (bigger = better)
• Inference at scale (serve billions of users)
• Enterprise AI (lock in corporate customers)
• AGI race (whoever gets there first owns the future)

Compute = power. Power = money. Money = more compute.

6/9 🔥 ALPHABET'S NEW AI RISKS

In their latest annual report, Alphabet added NEW AI-related risks for the first time:
• Potential impact on advertising revenue
• Competitive pressure from AI-native companies
• Regulatory uncertainty

They're acknowledging: AI is disrupting THEM too.

Even Google is worried about getting disrupted.

7/9 🏢 THE MONDAY.COM WARNING

Monday.com stock dropped 21% yesterday.

Why? AI disruption fears.

Software companies are realizing: AI tools could REPLACE entire categories of SaaS.

Why pay $50/month for project management when an AI agent can do it for $5?

The software business model is under attack.

8/9 🌍 THE SCALE IS UNPRECEDENTED

$588B is:
• More than Germany's entire defense budget
• 5x NASA's annual budget
• Enough to build 100+ nuclear reactors
• 2% of U.S. GDP

And this is just FOUR companies.

Add in OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Alibaba, ByteDance, Baidu… the global AI capex race is easily $1 TRILLION+.

9/9 🧠 THE TAKEAWAY

When Big Tech spends this much money, they're not guessing.

They have internal data we don't see:
• AI usage growth rates
• Enterprise demand pipelines
• Model performance curves

$588B says: "AI is the biggest shift since the internet."

And they're not waiting to see who wins — they're building to BE the winners.
