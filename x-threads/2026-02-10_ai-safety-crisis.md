🚨 BREAKING: The AI safety crisis just went from simmer to boil.

Two massive events in 24 hours that everyone needs to see.

**Tweet 2/9:**
First: Leaked memos from OpenAI reveal internal battles over "safety vs. speed."

The debate? Whether to slow down AI development for safety... or push full throttle toward AGI.

Sam Altman's camp: "We can't afford to wait."

Critics: "Profit over ethics."

**Tweet 3/9:**
The leaks ignited a firestorm on X.

35,000+ likes. 10,000+ replies.

The phrase "selling souls for AGI" is trending.

People are ANGRY. And they're asking: "Who's really in control here?"

**Tweet 4/9:**
Second event: A top Anthropic engineer just resigned.

Mrinank Sharma didn't quit quietly.

He posted this:

"The world is in peril. AI is just one of the crises we're juggling. Bioweapons, global politics, breakneck tech changes — it's all piling up."

Let that sink in.

One of the people BUILDING AI safety at Anthropic — the company literally founded on the idea of "safer AI" — just walked away saying the WORLD is in peril.

Not just AI. The world.

**Tweet 7/9:**
These aren't isolated incidents.

This is a pattern.

→ OpenAI: Internal conflict over pace vs. safety
→ Anthropic: Top talent walking away citing existential risks
→ Industry-wide: The race is accelerating faster than governance can keep up

**Tweet 8/9:**
Here's what's really happening:

The people closest to this technology — the engineers, the researchers, the ones building it — are sounding alarm bells.

Meanwhile, the companies are locked in an arms race.

Nobody wants to be second.

**Tweet 9/9:**
So what happens next?

Either we slow down and figure out how to build this safely...

Or we keep racing — and hope we don't build something we can't control.

The choice is happening NOW. Not in 10 years.

Right now.
