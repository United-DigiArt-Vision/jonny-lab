1/10 🚨 BREAKING: OpenAI will release an "updated Chat model" THIS WEEK

Sam Altman just told employees ChatGPT is "back to exceeding 10% monthly growth" with 800 million weekly users.

And there's more — here's the full picture 👇

---

2/10 The numbers are wild:

• 800M weekly active users on ChatGPT
• Growth reaccelerated past 10% month-over-month
• Codex (their coding tool) grew 50% in a single week
• Altman called Codex growth "insane"

This comes after OpenAI declared "code red" in December 2025.

---

3/10 What's the new model?

Most likely a chat-optimized variant of GPT-5.3.

Last week they launched GPT-5.3-Codex (coding-focused). Now the chat version is coming — designed for everyday conversations, reasoning, and general use.

OpenAI is shipping FAST right now.

---

4/10 Why the urgency?

Anthropic has been eating OpenAI's lunch:

• Claude Code saw massive adoption in 2025
• Anthropic ran Super Bowl ads mocking ChatGPT's ad decision
• Claude Opus 4.6 just dropped with terrifying benchmark scores
• Anthropic raised $20B+ at $350B valuation

OpenAI can't afford to slow down.

---

5/10 Meanwhile: ChatGPT ads officially start testing TODAY.

OpenAI confirmed ads will appear at the bottom of chat responses for free and Go tier users.

Altman fired back at Anthropic's Super Bowl mockery, calling their ads "deceptive" — saying OpenAI would "never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts."

6/10 The bigger picture: OpenAI is closing in on a $100 BILLION funding round.

They need to show investors that ChatGPT isn't losing ground.

This week's model launch + growth numbers = ammunition for that fundraise.

---

7/10 The AI model war in February 2026:

• OpenAI: GPT-5.3-Codex ✅ + new Chat model (this week)
• Anthropic: Opus 4.6 + $20B funding + 10 GW data centers
• Google: Gemini 3 quietly improving
• xAI: Grok 3 pushing boundaries

We're watching the most expensive tech race in history unfold in real time.

---

8/10 What to watch this week:

• When exactly does the new model drop? (Could be any day)
• How does it compare to Claude Opus 4.6?
• Will the Codex growth continue at 50%/week?
• How do users react to ads in ChatGPT?

---

9/10 Key takeaway:

OpenAI's "code red" from December is working. Growth is back. New models shipping weekly.

But Anthropic isn't standing still either.

The winner of 2026 will be whoever ships the fastest while keeping quality high.

---

10/10 We're in the golden age of AI competition.

Every week brings new models, new benchmarks, new controversies.

Users win — because these companies are fighting to give you the best AI for free (or nearly free).

Buckle up. This week is going to be interesting. 🚀
