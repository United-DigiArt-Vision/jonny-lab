"I've decided to leave Anthropic. My last day will be February 9th."

"I've achieved what I wanted to here... but there is so much more I could say about the dilemma I'm facing."

A dilemma. What dilemma?

All piling up. All at once.

### Tweet 6/9 - Timing

```
6/9 Timing matters.

Last week: Claude's Cowork plugin caused $1 TRILLION in software company market cap losses.

ServiceNow, Salesforce, Microsoft - all down.
India's software index: -6% (worst day in 6 years)

And now their AI safety lead quits.
```

### Tweet 7/9 - What He Worked On

```
7/9 What was Mrinank working on?

✅ AI sycophancy research
✅ Defenses against AI-assisted bioterrorism
✅ Production deployment of those defenses

He helped build safeguards for the very AI that's now disrupting global markets.

And he walked away.
```

### Tweet 8/9 - The Poetry Twist

```
8/9 The twist?

Mrinank says he'd rather write POETRY now.

Not code. Not AI safety research.

Poetry.

"I've seen how hard it is to contribute in a high-integrity way. I no longer want to do this work."

That's not burnout. That's a moral exit.
```

### Tweet 9/9 - Fazit

```
9/9 What does this mean?

When the HEAD of AI Safety at one of the world's leading AI labs quits, citing moral concerns and "the world falling apart"...

You pay attention.

Anthropic is moving fast. Maybe too fast.

Who else will walk away? 🚀🔥
