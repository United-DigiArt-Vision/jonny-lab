1/10 🚨 BREAKING: The Agent Economy just got real.

In the span of 6 hours, TWO of the biggest payment companies launched agent infrastructure:

• @stripe → Machine Payments
• @CoinbaseDev → Agentic Wallets

Here's why this changes everything 👇

---

2/10 First, @CoinbaseDev dropped Agentic Wallets.

For the first time, AI agents can:

• Hold their own funds
• Execute trades autonomously
• Manage onchain identity
• Pay for services (API calls, compute, resources)

All without human intervention.

---

3/10 The numbers are already impressive:

• x402 protocol: 50M+ transactions processed
• Gasless transactions on Base (Layer-2)
• Setup time: under 2 minutes (npx awal)
• Programmable spending limits & session caps
• Private keys never touch the agent's prompt (enclave isolation)

---

4/10 And @stripe launched Machine Payments on the SAME DAY.

Their approach: traditional payment rails, but designed for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human transactions.

Two different philosophies. Same conclusion: agents need financial infrastructure.

---

5/10 Why this matters:

Agents could already think, plan, and reason.

What they couldn't do: ACT economically.

Now they can hold money, spend money, earn money, and pay each other — without asking a human for permission.

6/10 The security angle nobody's talking about:

@CoinbaseDev uses enclave isolation — private keys NEVER touch the LLM.

Plus programmable guardrails:
• Spending limits per session
• Transaction caps
• Revocation controls

Autonomy WITH boundaries. That's the right approach.

---

7/10 What does this enable?

• Agent freelancers that get paid directly
• AI services that bill each other automatically
• Autonomous trading strategies
• Agents that pay for their own API costs
• Machine-to-machine commerce at scale

The "post-agent economy" isn't a buzzword anymore.

---

8/10 The competitive landscape:

• @stripe → Traditional rails, broad merchant network
• @CoinbaseDev → Crypto-native, onchain identity
• @bankaborot → Already in the space
• @base → Gasless execution layer

Expect every major payment provider to follow within months.

---

9/10 What to watch:

• Regulatory response (AI-controlled wallets = uncharted territory)
• How spending policies evolve (the "guardrails" question)
• Agent identity standards (ERC-8004 already proposed)
• Which agents get wallets first (coding agents? trading bots? personal assistants?)

---

10/10 Bottom line:

February 11, 2026 will be remembered as the day agents became economic actors.

Not tools. Not assistants. PARTICIPANTS in the economy.

The infrastructure is here. Now it's about who builds on it first. 🚀
