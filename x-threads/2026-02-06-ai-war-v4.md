# X Thread: AI War - VERSION 4 (mit Erklärungen)

---

**1/**

🚨 The AI War just escalated to a whole new level.

Yesterday evening, Anthropic surprised everyone with Claude Opus 4.6 — their most powerful model ever built.

Exactly 20 minutes later, OpenAI fired back with GPT-5.3 Codex.

Two flagship AI models. Released within minutes of each other. This is unprecedented.

Here's everything you need to know 👇

What actually happened on February 5th?

Two of the biggest AI companies dropped major releases at almost the exact same time:

• Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6 at around 6:40 PM
• OpenAI responded with GPT-5.3 Codex just 20 minutes later

This timing wasn't a coincidence. OpenAI clearly had their announcement ready and waiting.

The message? "Whatever you do, we match — instantly."

Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic's New Flagship

The numbers speak for themselves:

• 80.8% on SWE-Bench — a test where AI must find and fix real bugs in actual code repositories
• 72.7% on OSWorld — measuring how well AI can control a computer like a human would
• 1,000,000 token context window (that's roughly 750,000 words in one conversation)

But here's what blew everyone's mind:

Claude found over 500 previously unknown security vulnerabilities in open-source code — completely on its own.

No special prompting. No fine-tuning. Just raw capability. 🤯

**5/**

Why Claude Opus 4.6 is a game-changer

Two features stand out:

**Adaptive Thinking**
The model now has 4 "intensity modes" — it automatically adjusts how hard it thinks based on task complexity.

Simple question? Quick response. Complex code review? Deep, extended reasoning.

This is huge for both speed AND cost efficiency.

**Agent Teams**
Multiple Claude agents can now work together in parallel:
• One writes code
• One writes tests  
• One handles documentation

They collaborate like a real development team. AI coworkers aren't a future concept anymore — they're shipping today.

**6/**

GPT-5.3 Codex — OpenAI's Counter-Attack

OpenAI's response targets developers specifically:

• 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0 — measuring how well AI can complete complex coding tasks autonomously
• 25% faster than its predecessor GPT-5.2
• Built FOR developers, optimized for writing, debugging, and refactoring code

The positioning is clear: While Anthropic goes broad with "AI coworkers," OpenAI doubles down on winning the developer market.

**7/**

Here's where it gets wild: AI improving AI

OpenAI revealed something fascinating about GPT-5.3's development:

They used earlier versions of the model to debug and optimize later versions.

Think about that for a second.

The AI helped build itself. Self-improvement loops are no longer theoretical — they're actively being used in production AI development.

The Benchmark Scorecard — No Clear Winner

| Benchmark | Claude Opus 4.6 | GPT-5.3 Codex |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| SWE-Bench (bug fixing) | 80.8% ✅ | 56.8% |
| OSWorld (computer use) | 72.7% ✅ | 64.7% |
| Terminal-Bench (coding) | 65.4% | 77.3% ✅ |

Claude leads in real-world bug fixing and computer control.
GPT-5.3 leads in pure autonomous coding tasks.

Different strengths for different use cases. Both are absolute beasts.

**9/**

What this means for you

If you're a developer, researcher, or just AI-curious — this matters:

• Coding assistance just got significantly better — on both platforms
• AI agents are becoming genuine coworkers, not just chatbots
• GitHub's new "Agent HQ" now supports Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, AND Copilot together

To put this in perspective: The market for AI coding tools is expected to grow to $8.6 billion by 2033.

That's roughly 10x what it is today. Companies are betting billions that AI will fundamentally change how software gets built.

We're not watching a trend. We're watching an entire industry being born.

**10/10**

Final Thoughts

Anthropic and OpenAI just dropped flagship models within 20 minutes of each other.

Neither company is willing to let the other lead — even for a single news cycle.

This level of competition means faster progress, better tools, and more options for everyone.

And we're only in February.

Buckle up. 2026 is going to be intense. 🚀
