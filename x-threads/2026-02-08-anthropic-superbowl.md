1/ 🚨 AI WAR just went mainstream.

Anthropic is spending MILLIONS on Super Bowl ads tonight — to publicly mock OpenAI for putting ads in ChatGPT.

Sam Altman responded with a 420-word rant. The internet called it a "toddler tantrum."

Here's what's happening 👇

2/ What happened:

Anthropic is airing TWO commercials during Super Bowl LX tonight on NBC.

The ads show chatbots acting like sleazy salespeople — giving therapy advice, then suddenly pitching dating services.

Tagline: "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude."

---

3/ Why this matters:

OpenAI confirmed it's adding ads to free ChatGPT.

Anthropic says: that's a betrayal of user trust.

A single 30-second Super Bowl spot costs up to $10 MILLION. Anthropic bought TWO.

4/ Sam Altman's response was... something.

He posted a 420-word essay calling Anthropic "dishonest" and "deceptive."

"We bring AI to billions who can't pay. Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people."

5/ The best reactions:

"The digital equivalent of a toddler throwing a tantrum"

"Never respond to playful humour with an essay" — Nikita Bier (Head of Product at X)

6/ But there's MORE happening this week.

Both companies dropped major product updates:

• Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 — "plans more carefully, catches its own mistakes"

• OpenAI launched "Frontier" — a new enterprise AI platform

• OpenAI updated Codex — claims it can "do nearly anything"

---

7/ The bigger picture:

Both companies are burning BILLIONS and need to prove they can make money.

• OpenAI owes $1 TRILLION+ to backers (Oracle, Microsoft, Nvidia)

• Anthropic is backed by Amazon

• Google's Gemini is watching from the sidelines

The AI business model war is just beginning.

8/ The real question for users:

Do you want your AI assistant to:

A) Be free but show you ads and sell your data?
B) Cost money but stay neutral and private?

This Super Bowl moment is forcing everyone to pick a side.

---

9/ My take:

The fact that AI companies are buying Super Bowl ads shows we're in a completely new era.

3 years ago, most people had never heard of ChatGPT.

Tonight, 120 million people will watch two AI companies fight over YOUR attention.

---

10/10 The AI wars are no longer just about who has the best model.

They're about trust, business models, and who controls the future of how we think.

Super Bowl LX might be remembered as the moment AI went truly mainstream.

What side are you on? 👇
