1/10 🚨 BREAKING: Anthropic is about to close a $20 BILLION+ funding round

Valuation: $350 BILLION

That's nearly 2x their last valuation — from just 5 months ago.

Here's why this is insane 👇

---

2/10 Originally, Anthropic was targeting $10B

But investor demand was so strong, they DOUBLED it to $20B+

That's what happens when your revenue run rate hits $9 BILLION

5 months ago they raised $13B at $183B valuation. Now? Almost doubled.

---

3/10 The timeline is wild:

• 2021: Founded by ex-OpenAI researchers
• 2023: Amazon invests $4B, Google $2B
• 2025: Raised $13B at $183B valuation
• 2026: Now $20B+ at $350B valuation

From zero to $350B in 5 years. Let that sink in.

4/10 What's driving this? Claude Opus 4.6

Anthropic just dropped their most powerful model yet:

• End-to-end enterprise workflows
• Production-ready outputs on first attempt
• Coding agents that write software with minimal human input

The launch triggered a MULTI-BILLION dollar selloff in software stocks.

5/10 For context — $350B would make Anthropic worth more than:

• Goldman Sachs (~$200B)
• IBM (~$250B)
• AMD (~$200B)

A 4-year-old AI startup. Worth more than century-old Wall Street giants.

6/10 The AI funding race in numbers:

• OpenAI: $40B raised, $300B valuation (Apr 2025)
• Anthropic: $20B+ raising, $350B valuation (Feb 2026)
• xAI: $12B raised (Dec 2024)

Anthropic just leapfrogged OpenAI in valuation. The student surpasses the master?

---

7/10 Why investors are going ALL IN:

• Revenue grew from ~$1B to $9B+ in one year
• Enterprise adoption exploding
• Coding agents becoming industry standard
• "Constitutional AI" = safety leadership
• Dario Amodei seen as the "principled visionary"

---

8/10 The bigger picture:

Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO) said it best this week:

"Anthropic is making great money. OpenAI is making great money."

AI companies aren't just burning cash anymore. They're printing revenue.

---

9/10 What this means for the industry:

• AI is now the most valuable sector in tech
• Enterprise AI adoption is accelerating fast
• The competition between Claude & ChatGPT benefits everyone
• We're in the golden age of AI development

---

10/10 $350 BILLION for a company founded in 2021.

$9B+ revenue run rate.

Investors literally DOUBLED their commitment mid-round.

This isn't hype anymore. This is the biggest tech shift since the internet.

The question isn't IF AI will transform everything — it's how fast.
