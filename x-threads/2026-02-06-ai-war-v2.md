**1/**
🚨 The AI War just escalated to a new level.

Yesterday, Anthropic dropped Claude Opus 4.6.

Exactly 20 MINUTES later, OpenAI fired back with GPT-5.3 Codex.

Two flagship models. One night.

Here's everything you need to know 👇

**2/**
What just happened?

• Claude Opus 4.6: Anthropic's most powerful model ever — a flagship release nobody expected

• GPT-5.3 Codex: OpenAI's developer-focused counter-attack, released within minutes

This wasn't coincidence. This was war.

**3/**
Claude Opus 4.6 — The Numbers

• 80.8% on SWE-Bench Verified (bug fixing)
• 72.7% on OSWorld (computer control)
• 1,000,000 token context window
• 500+ zero-day vulnerabilities found in open-source code

Yes — 500+ security flaws. Out of the box. 🤯

**5/**
Why Opus 4.6 is a game-changer

• Adaptive Thinking: 4 intensity modes — the model adjusts HOW HARD it thinks based on task complexity

• Agent Teams: Multiple Claude agents work in parallel (code + test + docs)

AI coworkers aren't coming. They're HERE.

---

**6/**
GPT-5.3 Codex — OpenAI's Response

• 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0 (agentic coding)
• 25% faster than GPT-5.2
• Developer-first design

But here's the wildest part...

---

**7/**
AI improving AI

OpenAI used EARLIER versions of GPT-5.3 to debug and optimize LATER versions.

Self-improvement loops are no longer science fiction.

They're shipping in production. Right now.

**8/**
The Scorecard — No Clear Winner

| Benchmark | Claude Opus 4.6 | GPT-5.3 Codex |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| SWE-Bench | 80.8% ✅ | 56.8% |
| OSWorld | 72.7% ✅ | 64.7% |
| Terminal-Bench | 65.4% | 77.3% ✅ |

Different strengths. Both are absolute BEASTS.

**9/**
What this means for YOU

• Coding assistance just got 10x better
• AI agents are becoming actual coworkers
• GitHub's Agent HQ now supports BOTH (Claude Code + Codex + Copilot)

The AI coding market hits $8.6 BILLION by 2033.

**10/10**
Final Thoughts

Anthropic and OpenAI dropped flagship models within 20 minutes of each other.

The message is clear: neither company will let the other lead.

This is just February.

Buckle up. 🚀
