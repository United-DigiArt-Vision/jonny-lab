**Subject:** HACKER NEWS — Nedim Agic, Full-Stack Developer Application

Hi Adam,

I just applied through BambooHR and wanted to follow up directly as you suggested.

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building products in niche industries — and Starwood's mission of safely transporting pets worldwide genuinely excites me. The combination of a customer portal and a new quoting/checkout tool is exactly the kind of project I thrive on.

**Why I'm a good fit:**

- **Django & Python** — I build backend systems, APIs, and data pipelines with Python daily.
- **Full-stack versatility** — From Django templates and JavaScript frontends to PostgreSQL and cloud infrastructure, I work across the entire stack.
- **Integration experience** — I've built systems connecting HubSpot, Stripe, SendGrid, and 10+ other services — exactly the integrations on your stack.
- **Comfortable being nimble** — As a solo founder, I'm used to wearing many hats and jumping between projects. Diversity of projects is a feature, not a bug.
- **Product thinking** — I don't just write code, I think about the customer experience. A quoting tool that "just works" is worth more than a technically perfect one nobody uses.

**About me:**
I run United DigiArt Vision, where I build AI-powered web applications and automation tools. I bring the mindset of someone who's built entire products from scratch — from database design to deployment.

I'd be excited to bring that energy to Starwood's growing tech team.

Best regards,
Nedim Agic
