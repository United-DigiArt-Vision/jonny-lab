Hi Hamish,

Your HN post caught my attention — $2.5M ARR in 24 months, bootstrapped, with a genuinely useful product. That's the kind of company I want to build at.

**Why this role excites me:**

Order Editing solves a real, expensive problem — and the upsell angle ("there's space in your package for X") is brilliant. Working on a product used by brands like Mejuri and Hexclad, with direct impact on their CX and revenue, is exactly where I want to be.

**What I bring:**

- **Full-stack, product-obsessed** — I've built entire SaaS products from scratch. I think in user problems, not just code.
- **Speed + quality** — As a founder myself, I know how to ship fast without cutting corners. Working prototypes in days, polished products in weeks.
- **Shopify ecosystem** — Experience with e-commerce platforms, payment integrations (Stripe), and the operational side of running a tech product.
- **AI-augmented development** — I use AI tools to move faster without sacrificing quality. I build AI-powered features that customers actually use.
- **Clear communicator** — I talk to customers, not just keyboards. I've run my own business, so I understand both the technical and commercial side.

**About me:**
I'm the founder of United DigiArt Vision, where I build software products and AI automation tools. I've shipped web apps, mobile apps, CI/CD pipelines, and API integrations — always with a focus on what moves the needle for the business.

Joining as your second engineer at this stage is exciting because the decisions we make now will define the product for years. I'd love to be part of that.

Best,
Nedim Agic
