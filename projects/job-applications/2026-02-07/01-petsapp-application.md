Hi PetsApp team,

I'm a full-stack developer and founder of United DigiArt Vision, where I build AI-powered products from concept to production — fast.

**Why I'm a great fit:**

- **TypeScript, React, NestJS, AWS** — my daily stack. I build and ship production apps end-to-end.
- **AI in the real world** — I've built AI-powered automation systems, GPT-integrated tools, and multi-modal pipelines (image → data extraction). Not demos — production systems used by real people.
- **Product-minded engineer** — I come from a business background. Every line of code I write solves a real user problem. I think in user stories, not just tickets.
- **Shipping speed** — As a solo founder, I've learned to move fast: working prototypes in days, production-ready in weeks.

**What excites me about PetsApp:**

Your AI clinic assistant is exactly the kind of product I love building — multi-modal AI solving real problems for real people. Booking, records, FAQs — this is the messy, valuable work where great engineering meets genuine impact. Making AI "feel magical, not clunky" is my north star too.

**Relevant experience:**
- Built a community app platform with AI-powered event extraction (camera → GPT-4V → structured data)
- Designed and deployed CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, GitHub Actions workflows
- Full-stack React + Node.js/NestJS applications with AWS infrastructure
- API integrations connecting 10+ services
- React Native mobile development

I'd love to bring my speed, product intuition, and AI experience to the PetsApp team.

Best regards,
Nedim Agic
