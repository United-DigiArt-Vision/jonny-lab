## Cover Letter

Hi CEF AI team,

I'm applying for the AI Innovator role. Your approach — building original systems, not wrappers — resonates deeply with how I work.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

- **AI product experience** — I've built production AI systems: multi-modal pipelines (image → GPT-4V → structured data), AI-powered automation tools, and intelligent agents that actually ship.
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — I run a multi-agent AI system daily where I orchestrate specialized sub-agents for different tasks. I understand the challenges of agent coordination, context management, and reliable execution.
- **Concept to scale** — I've taken products from idea to production to revenue as a solo founder. I know what it takes to go from 0→1 and make it stick.
- **Strong backend/systems** — Python, TypeScript, Node.js, AWS/GCP infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker).
- **Fast iteration** — Small team, high ownership, low bureaucracy — that's my natural environment. I prototype fast and iterate based on real usage.

**What I'd bring to CEF AI:**

The ability to prototype and ship production AI features at startup speed, combined with the architectural thinking to make them scale. I'm comfortable with ambiguity, excited about privacy/security challenges, and I have the product intuition to know what to build next.

Looking forward to discussing how I can contribute.

Best regards,
