🚨 Anthropic just dropped Claude Opus 4.6 — and it's a BEAST.

1M token context window.
Beats GPT-5.2 by 144 Elo.
#1 on every major benchmark.

This might be the most capable AI model ever released.

Here's everything you need to know 👇

What changed?

Opus 4.6 can now:
• Handle 1 MILLION tokens (that's ~750K words)
• Plan complex tasks more carefully
• Debug its own mistakes
• Stay productive in longer sessions

For context: GPT-4 launched with just 8K tokens. We're at 125x that now.

The benchmarks are INSANE.

📊 Terminal-Bench 2.0 (agentic coding): #1
📊 Humanity's Last Exam (complex reasoning): #1  
📊 BrowseComp (finding info online): #1
📊 BigLaw Bench (legal reasoning): 90.2%

It's not just beating competitors — it's lapping them.

The economic value test is wild.

GDPval-AA measures performance on real business tasks (finance, legal, etc.).

Opus 4.6 beats:
• GPT-5.2 by 144 Elo points
• Opus 4.5 by 190 Elo points

That's not incremental — that's a generational leap.

Context rot = when AI gets confused in long conversations.

Old models degraded fast. Opus 4.6?

On MRCR v2 (finding needles in a haystack):
• Opus 4.6: 76%
• Sonnet 4.5: 18.5%

That's 4x better at tracking info across massive documents.

---

### 7/ (251 chars)
For developers, three new features:

🔧 Agent Teams: Multiple AI agents collaborating
🔧 Adaptive Thinking: Auto-adjusts reasoning depth
🔧 Effort Controls: Trade speed vs intelligence

Claude Code just became a proper dev team.

---

### 8/ (236 chars)
For everyone else:

📊 Claude in Excel (major upgrade)
📊 Claude in PowerPoint (NEW)
📊 Cowork: Claude multitasks autonomously

The vision: Claude does your spreadsheets, presentations, and research — while you focus on decisions.

---

### 9/ (237 chars)
What about safety?

Anthropic ran their most comprehensive safety evals ever.

Result: Same or better safety profile than Opus 4.5, which was already their most aligned model.

More capability WITHOUT more risk. That's rare.

---

### 10/ (201 chars)
Bottom line:

Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art across coding, reasoning, context, and real-world business tasks.

Available now. Same pricing ($5/$25 per million tokens).

The AI race just got interesting. 🚀
