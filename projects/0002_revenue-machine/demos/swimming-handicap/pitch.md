# Upwork Pitch — Swimming Handicap System

**Job:** Custom System Development for Staggered-Start Handicap Swimming Events

---

Hi there,

I saw your posting and it immediately caught my attention — I understand handicap swimming formats well (staggered starts based on ability, where slower swimmers go first and faster swimmers chase).

**I've already built a working demo for your use case:** [link to demo]

It includes:
- **Swimmer management** with personal bests and automatic handicap calculation
- **Race setup** — select participants, auto-calculated staggered start times
- **Live race mode** — one-tap finish recording with real-time timer
- **Results & leaderboard** — adjusted times, race history, medal placement

The demo is fully functional and mobile-friendly, so your timekeepers can use it poolside on a tablet or phone.

**My approach:**
1. Week 1: Refine the demo based on your specific club rules and requirements
2. Week 2: Add data persistence, user accounts, and your custom scoring logic
3. Week 3: Testing with your club, refinements, deployment

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years experience. I specialise in turning real-world problems into clean, working software — fast.

Happy to jump on a quick call to discuss your specific needs.

Best regards,
Nedim
