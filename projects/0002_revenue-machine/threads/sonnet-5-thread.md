What is Claude Sonnet 5?

Anthropic's next-generation mid-tier model, codenamed "Fennec".

Leaked model ID: claude-sonnet-5@20260203

The date string (20260203) suggests a February 3, 2026 checkpoint - meaning it could launch ANY DAY now.

🔍 THE PROOF: HTTP 403 vs 404

A developer ran a port scan against Vertex AI:

• Fake ID "claude-sonnet-99": Returns 404 (doesn't exist)
• Leaked ID "claude-sonnet-5": Returns 403 (exists, but access denied)

This confirms the model is REAL and waiting for public release.

## 4/

📊 Expected Performance (based on leaks):

• SWE-Bench: Over 80.9% (matching or exceeding Opus 4.5!)
• Coding: Stronger than Opus 4.5 in certain workflows
• Math: Competitive with frontier models
• Context: 128k tokens tested (rumors of 1M)

💰 WHY THIS IS A GAME-CHANGER: Pricing

Sonnet 5 is rumored to cost 50% LESS than Opus 4.5.

That means:
• Opus-level performance
• At Sonnet-level prices
• For coding, reasoning, and agent tasks

This could reshape the entire AI pricing landscape.

🤖 New Capabilities (rumored):

• "Dev Team Mode": Spawn specialized sub-agents working in parallel
• Agent-to-Agent Communication
• Deeper Claude Code integration
• Improved context retention
• Better multitasking

Perfect for complex, long-running workflows.

⚡ WHY NOW? The TPU Advantage

In October 2025, Anthropic secured access to 1 MILLION Google TPUs.

That's tens of billions of dollars in compute power.

Sonnet 5 is TPU-optimized, meaning faster inference at lower cost.

## 8/

📅 Release Timeline:

• Opus 4.6: Released TODAY (Feb 5, 2026) ✅
• Sonnet 5: Expected within days
• Timing: Super Bowl Week (Feb 8)

Anthropic is clearly in launch mode. Fennec could drop any moment.

⚠️ What's NOT confirmed:

• Exact release date
• Final pricing
• Full benchmark numbers
• 1M context window

Anthropic hasn't officially announced anything yet. These are leaks and educated speculation.

## 10/10

Final Thoughts:

If these leaks are accurate, Sonnet 5 could be the most cost-effective frontier model ever released.

Opus performance. Sonnet pricing. TPU speed.

The AI race just got more interesting. Stay tuned. 🚀
