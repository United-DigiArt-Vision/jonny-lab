## Professional Overview (max 5,000 chars)

```
🤖 I help small businesses discover where AI can actually make a difference.

Not with hype. Not with generic advice. With a detailed analysis of YOUR workflows and a clear roadmap to implementation.

---

**THE PROBLEM I SOLVE:**

You know AI could help your business. You've heard about ChatGPT, automation tools, and "10x productivity." But when you look at your actual day-to-day work, you have no idea where to start.

That's where I come in.

---

**WHAT I DO:**

I conduct comprehensive AI Workflow Audits for small businesses. Here's the process:

1. **Discovery** - You complete a detailed questionnaire about your business (10 min)
2. **Analysis** - I map your workflows and identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and automation opportunities
3. **Recommendations** - You receive a detailed PDF report with specific, actionable recommendations
4. **Delivery** - Everything delivered in 48-72 hours. No calls, no meetings.

---

**WHAT YOU GET:**

✅ Complete workflow analysis
✅ Specific AI tool recommendations tailored to YOUR needs
✅ ROI estimates for each opportunity
✅ Prioritized implementation roadmap
✅ Quick wins you can implement immediately
✅ Budget-conscious options (I won't recommend $500/month tools if you're a solopreneur)

→ Anyone drowning in repetitive, manual tasks
