## Cover Letter

Hi! Building a purpose-built marketplace for craftsmen with AI-driven workflows — this is a project I'd love to own long-term.

I built a working prototype of what your platform could look like:
→ [DEMO_LINK]

It includes:
• Search craftsmen by trade/location
• Craftsmen profiles with ratings and availability
• AI project scope wizard — customer describes what they need, AI suggests trades, estimated cost, and timeline
• Job posting and matching flow

My technical approach:
• Frontend: Next.js + React (fast, SEO-friendly)
• Backend: Node.js/TypeScript + PostgreSQL
• AI: OpenAI API for scope analysis, image processing for project visualization
• Architecture: Designed to scale from day 1 — modular, well-documented, ready for 2026+

I think in systems and long-term scalability, not quick hacks. Happy to discuss architecture decisions and shape the product together.

Timeline: Core MVP in 4-6 weeks, iterative expansion from there.

Best,
Nedim — United DigiArt Vision
