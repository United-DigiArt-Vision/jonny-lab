Hi! This is exactly the kind of project I thrive on — a clean React frontend waiting for a production-ready backend, built fast with AI tools.

**I built a working demo of what your backend could look like:**
→ https://digit500.github.io/booking-platform-backend-demo/

It includes: Auth (JWT + bcrypt + RBAC), Event CRUD, Booking with capacity management, Stripe payment intent flow, webhook handling, and full OpenAPI docs.

**My stack for this project:**
- TypeScript + Express/Fastify
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Stripe (payments + webhooks)
- JWT auth (or open to your recommendation)
- Deployed on Fly/Render

**How I work:**
- AI-first workflow (Cursor, Claude, Copilot daily)
- Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- Pragmatic architecture — production-ready, not over-engineered
- Independent with light product direction

**Timeline:** Core backend MVP in 1 week, payment flow + polish in week 2.

Happy to review the detailed spec and wireframes whenever you're ready to share.

Best,
Nedim — United DigiArt Vision
