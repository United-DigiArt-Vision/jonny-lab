## Cover Letter

Hi! This is exactly what I build — AI-powered document workflows that are simple for the user but powerful under the hood.

I built a working demo of your Document→Form system:
→ [DEMO_LINK]

It shows the full flow:
• Image upload/capture → OCR extraction → AI response → Multi-step form auto-fill → Submit & confirm

My approach for your project:
• OCR: Google Vision API (best accuracy for mixed languages/formats)
• AI: GPT-4 for response generation with templates
• Form filling: Playwright/Puppeteer for reliable multi-page navigation
• Error handling: Retries, validation, screenshot on failure
• iOS + Android: React Native (one codebase, both platforms)

I keep things simple — clean architecture, no over-engineering. The user takes a photo, everything else happens automatically.

Timeline: Working MVP in 2-3 weeks, polished app in 6 weeks.

Happy to discuss details and show you the demo live.

Best,
Nedim — United DigiArt Vision
