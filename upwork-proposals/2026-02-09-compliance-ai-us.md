## Cover Letter

Hi! I've built AI-powered document analysis tools before and this is right in my wheelhouse.

I built a working demo of your compliance decision-support tool:
→ [DEMO_LINK]

It shows:
• Document upload (Word, Excel, PDF) with drag-and-drop
• AI analysis with structured output: risk level, missing info, recommended next steps
• Guardrails — scope limits, conservative language, refusal of evasion attempts
• Download results as formatted report
• Subscription gate (Stripe-ready)
• Multilingual support — auto-detects language, responds in kind
• Fully responsive (works on phone)

My stack for this build:
• Frontend: React/Next.js — responsive, mobile-first
• Backend: Node.js + OpenAI API (GPT-4)
• Payments: Stripe (subscriptions, trials, feature gating)
• Documents: docx/xlsx/pdf parsing + generation
• Deploy: Vercel or AWS

I focus on strong guardrails and structured AI output — not generic chat responses, but reliable, formatted compliance analysis.

Phase 1 timeline: 4-5 weeks for production-ready MVP.

Happy to discuss scope and share the demo live.

Best,
Nedim — United DigiArt Vision
