Hi! I'm an EU-based (Germany) full-stack developer with deep n8n expertise and a strong REST API background.

Here's what I bring to the table:

**n8n Experience:**

  • Hive Project Management + n8n: https://github.com/digit500/hive-n8n-integration
  • OpenAgents AI Framework + n8n: https://github.com/digit500/openagents-n8n
- Experienced with webhooks, triggers, custom nodes, API orchestration, error handling, and retry logic

**I put together a portfolio page showcasing my n8n work:**

**What you get:**
- EU-based (Germany) — same timezone, GDPR-aware
- Available 30+ hrs/week for long-term collaboration
- Strong backend: Node.js, Python, TypeScript, REST APIs
- Fast, reliable, well-documented work
- AI integration experience (OpenAI, Claude, automation pipelines)

Happy to start with a small test task to prove the fit. Looking forward to hearing about your first project!

Best,
