# Daily Learning Sweep - 2026-02-08

**Status:** ❌ Failed to execute

## Issue
- `blogwatcher` command not found in sandboxed cron environment
- Cron jobs run in isolated Docker containers without access to host tools

## Next Steps
- Need to either:
  1. Install blogwatcher in the sandbox image, OR
  2. Run this task from main session instead of cron, OR
  3. Use alternative approach (direct RSS parsing, web fetch, etc.)

## Recommendation
Since blogwatcher requires specific setup and the cron environment is isolated, this task might be better suited as a **heartbeat check** in the main session where I have access to all tools, or the sandbox needs blogwatcher pre-installed.
