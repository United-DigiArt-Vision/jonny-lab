## Top Findings

### 1. 🔥 OpenAI Skills now in API (Simon Willison)
- OpenAI Skills can now be sent **inline as base64-encoded zips** in API requests
- Uses the `shell` tool with `container_auto` environment
- Simon used Showboat (Claude Code for web) to explore the API
- **Relevance:** We already use Skills (OpenClaw). This shows the pattern is becoming standard across the industry. Could offer "Skills as a Service" via API too.

### 2. ⚠️ OpenAI Disbands Mission Alignment Team
- Team (~6-7 people) that communicated OpenAI's mission to public/employees is gone
- Former leader Josh Achiam becomes "Chief Futurist" instead
- Follows pattern: superalignment team dissolved (2024), now mission alignment
- **Relevance:** Industry trend — safety/alignment teams keep getting cut. Worth monitoring but not actionable for us.

### 3. 🛠️ Claude Code v2.1.20 — Verbose Mode Controversy
- New version hides file paths and search patterns behind summary lines ("Read 3 files")
- Community backlash on GitHub (30+ complaints)
- Anthropic's fix: "use verbose mode" — which dumps too much info
- **Relevance:** We use Claude via OpenClaw (not Claude Code CLI directly), so not directly affected. But good to know the community sentiment. If we ever recommend Claude Code to clients, this is a UX issue to flag.

### 4. 💰 Modal Labs raising at $2.5B (inference boom continues)
- Modal Labs (AI inference infra) in talks at $2.5B, up from $1.1B five months ago
- ARR ~$50M, General Catalyst leading
- Joins Baseten ($5B), Fireworks AI ($4B), Inferact/vLLM ($800M), RadixArk/SGLang ($400M)
- **Relevance:** Inference infrastructure is THE hot sector. Massive VC money flowing in. If we build AI products, inference costs will keep dropping — good for us.

### 5. 📰 GLM-5: "From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering" (Zhipu AI)
- New model from Chinese AI lab Zhipu (z.ai)
- Positioning as competitor in coding/agent space
- Page didn't load fully — worth revisiting
- Source: https://z.ai/blog/glm-5

### 6. 🔒 Cisco AI BOM (Bill of Materials) in AI Defense
- New feature: AI BOM for tracking AI stack components
- **Relevance:** Security angle — if we do enterprise AI consulting, knowing AI supply chain tools matters.
- Source: https://blogs.cisco.com/ai/know-your-ai-stack-introducing-ai-bom-in-cisco-ai-defense/

### 7. xAI co-founders leaving after SpaceX merger
- More senior engineers/co-founders exiting xAI
- Elon says it's "push not pull" (fired, not quit)
- Interplanetary ambitions discussed at all-hands
- **Relevance:** xAI talent pool opening up. Not directly actionable but interesting market signal.

## Monetarisierungs-Check 💰
- **OpenAI Skills in API** → Validates our "AI Skills as a Service" concept. We could package custom skills for clients and deliver them via API.
- **Inference boom** → Dropping costs = our AI products become cheaper to run = better margins.
- **Claude Code controversy** → Opportunity: if developers are frustrated with Claude Code UX, OpenClaw's approach (agent framework, not just CLI) is a differentiator.
