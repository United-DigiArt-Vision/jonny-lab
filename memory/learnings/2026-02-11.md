## Top Findings (67 unread articles scanned)

### 1. 🔧 Showboat + Rodney — Agent Demo Tools (Simon Willison)
- **Showboat:** CLI tool that lets coding agents build Markdown docs demonstrating what they built (exec commands, capture output, screenshots)
- **Rodney:** CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat — agents can screenshot their web UIs as proof
- **Key Insight:** "Code must be proven to work" — agents need to demonstrate, not just claim
- **Relevanz für uns:** We could use similar patterns for our freelance demos. Build → auto-screenshot → send to client. Also relevant for our own QA (PRD-Pflicht!).
